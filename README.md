# Our Services

## Scalable Backend Development

We architect and develop high-performance backend services in GoLang, optimized for scalability and efficiency. Whether you're building a microservices-based platform or a distributed system, our expertise ensures robust, fault-tolerant solutions designed to handle complex workloads on AWS or GCP.

## Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) and x509 Solutions
We have extensive experience in developing secure and customized Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) solutions. From building a fully functional Certificate Authority (CA) and Registration Authority (RA) to integrating ACME clients and implementing STIR/SHAKEN protocols for securing communications, we provide end-to-end security solutions tailored to your needs.

## HSM and Virtual HSM Integration
We specialize in integrating secure key management solutions using Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) and Virtual HSMs. Whether your system requires secure key storage, cryptographic operations, or compliance with industry standards, we ensure smooth integration with leading HSM providers.

## Authentication & Authorization (AuthN & AuthZ)
Security is at the core of every modern application. We design and implement robust authentication (AuthN) and authorization (AuthZ) solutions, ensuring secure access control for web and API-based systems. Whether you're using OpenID Connect, OAuth 2.0, or custom authentication flows, we provide scalable and secure implementations.

## OAuth and DPoP Security
We develop and secure OAuth-based authentication systems, ensuring protection against token misuse and replay attacks. Our expertise includes implementing OAuth 2.0 with Demonstrating Proof of Possession (DPoP) to enhance security in token-based authentication, reducing the risks of unauthorized API access.

## Secure Infrastructure and Deployment Automation
We ensure secure and efficient deployments using Helm and Terraform. By leveraging Infrastructure as Code (IaC) best practices, we create automated, repeatable, and secure deployment pipelines for cloud-native applications, reducing manual overhead and enhancing security posture.
